The Natural Programming Project will study ways to make learning how to program significantly easier. More people will be able to create useful, interesting, and sophisticated programs. The goal is to study how nonprogrammers reason about programming concepts, then to create one or more new programming languages and environments that apply these findings.

For example, the new Java and JavaScript languages use the same mechanisms for looping, conditionals, and assignments that have been shown to cause many errors for both beginning and expert programmers in the C language.

A thorough investigation of the ESP and HCI literature revealed many results that can be used to guide the design of a new programming system. However, there are many significant "holes" in the knowledge about how people reason about programs and programming. We need to study about fundamental paradigms of computing are the most natural. Many new systems are object oriented (C++, Java), but systems aimed at novice programmers tend to be event based instead (Visual Basic, HyperTalk), and the language research community is studying functional styles. The old imperative style is easiest for beginning programmers. We will perform user studies to investigate this question.
